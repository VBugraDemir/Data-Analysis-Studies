# one of the fist step is looking the distribution of the data (distplot)
# distplot combines many of the features of the rugplot kdeplot and matplotlib into a single function

# regression plot is an example of a plot that  shows the relationship between two variables. (lmplot for facetting)

# matplotlib's scatter plot is a very simple method to compare the interaction of two variables on the x and y axis

# the lmplot combines many of these features of the underlying regplot and residplot and ability of facetting

# lmplot is the best function to use for determining LINEAR relationships between data

# CATEGORICAL

# boxplot or violinplot to examine the distribution of the variables then follow up with statistical estimation
# plots such as the point, bar or countplot

# to facet the data across columns or rows use factorplot()

# pairplot or joinplot visualizations are useful after you have done some preliminary analysis fo regression or
# distribution of the data.
# pair and joinplots are very useful  in understanding how two or more variables intract with each other.
